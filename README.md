**Overview**

This project, created as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course by Manal ElZant-Karray, focuses on managing a subjectâ€™s exam using a singly linked list (SLL). It involves implementing a variety of functions to manipulate and analyze the data of students participating in an exam.

The program stores each studentâ€™s:

    Name (string)
    Student Card ID Number (long integer)
    Exam Grade (float)
    A pointer to the next student.

**Additional Notes**

    Performance Enhancement: The split/merge functionality is implemented using the Merge Sort algorithm for efficient sorting.
    Error Handling: Ensure proper validation and memory management to avoid segmentation faults.
